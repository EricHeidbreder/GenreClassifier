    "\n",
    "* My models using extracted MFCCs outperform models using spotify's features.\n",
    "* When subgenres are present, a false prediction by the model tends to fall within related genres. For example: classical, baroque, and serialism were the most likely to be confused for each other, but those all fit under the umbrella of classical.\n",
    "* Because the model tends to predict well on more general genres (like the 5-genre model), this could beneficial for auto-generating recommended metadata for artists. **It would still need some human input** to better train, since an incorrect prediction here would lead to potential lost revenue for artists and unpleasant listening experiences for users (users might expect one genre but hear another).\n",
    "* Further exploration needs to be done to figure out why the subgenres are being classified together - OR this could be an interesting way to find intersections between genres that are sonically adjacent to each other.\n",
    "* If sub-genres are getting confused for each other, are there other factors that go into assigning sub-genre (What geographic location was it written? What are the lyrics about? When was it written?)"

    "## **Future Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimize the preprocessing steps (librosa still loads files quite slowly, it seems)\n",
    "* Include more genres/subgenres\n",
    "* Extract more features from the music: Tempo, pitch content, instrument types?\n",
    "* Run some unsupervised learning to see what clusters develop\n",
    "* Self-label genres to make sure they are correct. Since Spotify assigns genre based on artist, this means that when an artist features on a song that is not within their usual genre, or when a song is Remixed by another artist, there's a higher likelihood that the genre would be mislabeled in Spotify's database.\n",
    "* Deploy a web app that will tell you the genre of a song - useful for generating automatic metadata"
